# SP1 Contracts

This repository contains the smart contracts for verifying [SP1](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1) EVM proofs.

## Installation

> [!WARNING]
> [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) installs the latest release version initially, but subsequent `forge update` commands will use the `main` branch. This branch is the development branch and should be avoided in favor of tagged releases. The release process matches a specific SP1 version.

To install the latest release version:

```bash
forge install succinctlabs/sp1-contracts
```

To install a specific version:
```bash
forge install succinctlabs/sp1-contracts@<version>
```

Add `@sp1-contracts/=lib/sp1-contracts/contracts/src/` in `remappings.txt.`

### Usage

Once installed, you can use the contracts in the library by importing them:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.25;

import {SP1Verifier} from "@sp1-contracts/SP1Verifier.sol";

contract MyContract is SP1Verifier {
}
```
